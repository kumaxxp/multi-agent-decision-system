# Multi-Agent Decision System

This project implements a local multi-agent conversation system according to the design specified in `design_spec.md`. The system uses AutoGen to coordinate multiple language model agents and ReDel to log and visualize their dialogue. The initial prototype includes three agents:

- **Speaker Agent** – creative storyteller, allowed to hallucinate.
- **Verifier Agent** – cautious sidekick, cross-checks claims (placeholder for web-search tools).
- **Judge Agent** – mediator and decision maker, summarises discussion and proposes alternative solutions.

Refer to `design_spec.md` for detailed design guidance and future development steps.
